set -euf -o pipefail
In dash, set -o doesn't exist, so use only set -euf.

What do those do?

set -e

If a command fails, set -e will make the whole script exit, instead of just resuming on the next line. If you have commands that can fail without it being an issue, you can append || true or || : to suppress this behavior — for example set -e followed by false || : will not cause your script to terminate.

set -u

Treat unset variables as an error, and immediately exit.

set -f

Disable filename expansion (globbing) upon seeing \*, ?, etc..

If your script depends on globbing, you obviously shouldn't set this. Instead, you may find shopt -s failglob useful, which causes globs that don't get expanded to cause errors, rather than getting passed to the command with the \* intact.

set -o pipefail

set -o pipefail causes a pipeline (for example, curl -s https://sipb.mit.edu/ | grep foo) to produce a failure return code if any command errors. Normally, pipelines only return a failure if the last command errors. In combination with set -e, this will make your script exit if any command in a pipeline errors.
