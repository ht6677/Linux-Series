# 循环

Bash shell 可以一次又一次地重复特定的指令，直到满足特定条件为止。一组重复执行的指令称为循环。 Bash 支持 for 循环与 while 循环。Each and every loop must:

First, the variable used in loop condition must be initialized, then execution of the loop begins.
A test (condition) is made at the beginning of each iteration.
The body of loop ends with a statement that modifies the value of the test (condition) variable.
Repeatedly execute a block of statements.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

i=1

while [ $i -le 50 ]
do
    userdel -r stud${i}
    i=$(($i+1 ))
done
```

# for-in

```sh
INDEX=0
for i in $list; do
    echo ${INDEX}_$i
    let INDEX=${INDEX}+1
done
```
